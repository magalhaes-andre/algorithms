# Algorithms

This repository represents my form of studying algorithms, data structures and coding challenges that appear on interviews.

By any means this should be stated as the silver bullet in solving some of the issues here. These are just the way i solved or implemented them
in a way that made sense, was clear or seemed elegant enough.

## Repository Structure:

- root
  - source_of_knowledge
    - name_of_the_algorithm
      - implementation file
        
_This repository is agnostic although it will be starting strongly with Java._
